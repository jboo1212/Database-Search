# Database-Search
Welcome to my job database wrapper script!

Note: if you do not have the requests and Beautiful Soup modules installed on your 
computer, please take the time to install it now.  You will need BOTH for the script to work.

What it does:

This script is meant to search job database websites such as dice.com and indeed.com, for now.  My sentiments
for creating this program was to sort of automate/take the load off my shoulders of constantly searching for jobs.  Now,
as a developer and a job searcher, put the power in your hands.  

What you do:

When you run the program, it's very straightforward (or at least I think so): you'll enter a job you want to search for,
the city/state you want to search in, and some of the criteria you're looking for.  The program then scrapes dice or indeed
for your criteria such that ALL criteria is met; again, it'll all be explained in the program itself via print statements.

Hint: it may be a good idea to get a grip of what you're looking for specifically before you run the program.  

Future things to come: More websites (maybe), job radius inclusions; some, but not all criteria met specifications; 
sleeping program to scrape every 6 hours for jobs (definitively adding this soon), hosting on a website to make everything
more readable.
